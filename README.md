Pymaceuticals Summary

* Graph 'Tumor Response to Treatment' shows that the drugs Ramicane & Capomulin both had a positive impact on tumor volumes with Ramicane shrinking from 45 mm3 down to 34.95 mm3 and Capomulin shrinking from 45 mm3 down to 36.23 mm3. Placebo final result was 68.08 mm3 and Ketapril actually worsening tumor growth with a final result of 70.66 mm3.

* Graph 'Metastatic Spread During Treatment' also shows that both Ramicane & Capomulin had the greatest positive impact on metastatic spread, with Ramicane lowering spread to 1.25 average met. sites and Capomulin lowering average met. sites to 1.4. Placebo final result was 3.27 met. sites and Ketapril increasing average metastatic growth to 3.36.

* Graph 'Survival During Treatment' shows that 80% of the Ramicane tests survived and 84% of Capomulin test subjects survived during treatment. Placebo and Ketapril had a low survival rate of only 44%

* Between the compared drugs. Ramicane was the drug that showed the most reduction in tumor volume, slowest spread of metastatic sites, and a high survival rate during the course of trial.
